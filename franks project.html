                    There are just two weeks to go until the Manchester United first-team squad returns to the Aon Training Complex on Monday 1 July, to begin preparations for the 2019/20 season.
                    
                    Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has already spoken about his desire to oversee a hard-working training camp this summer, to provide his Reds with a stronger foundation of fitness for the campaign ahead. 
                    
                    The manager is also determined to properly instil his attacking philosophy in the group, after taking charge of the club on a caretaker basis last December before earning the full-time position in March. 
                    
                    Chances to coach the players on the training ground were limited in Solskjaer’s first half-a-season as boss, due to the abundance of fixtures that take place in the second half of a campaign. As such, Ole is excited by the prospect of working with his squad in a much more detailed way this summer.
